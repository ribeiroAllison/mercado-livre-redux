# Profit Margin Calculator for Mercado Livre E-commerce

![alt screenshot of the program](/public/images/screenshot.png "Program screenshot")

## What is it?
 It is a program that calculates the `profit margin` of a certain product sold in Mercado Livre, the `biggest marketplace in Brazil`.

## How it works?
The program receives `five params` and returns an info table with all the `detailed costs and expenses` involved in selling a product in Mercado Livre.

>**The params received are:**

- Type of ad (classic or premium)
- Selling price
- Product cost
- Selling tax
- Product weight


>**The outputs are:**

- Selling price
- Sale tax (in BRL)
- Commission from the marketplace
- Freight (based on weight)
- Product cost
- Net Profit
- Percentage of profit over sale's price
- Percentage of profit over the cost

## Project Goal

This will be `used by e-commerce companies` to calculate profit and product viability `faster and more conveniently` than a normal excel spreadsheet.

I also plan on adapting this project to React Native to `make it an app`.

## Main technologies used:

#### • React.js
#### • Next.js
#### • Styled Components
#### • Redux
#### • Jest
